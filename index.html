                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The visualization depicts the amount of Corona Virus Cases around the world
                through use of
                different highlighted regions which correspond to an above map that describes the amount of cases.
            </p>

                <span class="title">Domain: </span>
                <br/>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The users of this visualization can be described as those who are curious
                about the amount of individuals infected.
                This can be interpreted as doctors, companies as well as civilians who are curious.
            </p>

                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This visualization consists of Domain specific language identified as
                Geometry(spatial) within the book. The specified fields are noted as items as well as positions
                in relation to the regions highlighted by the amount of cases in that area. The attribute types can be
                identified as the ordering direction with the specific type being diverging.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="title">Idiom: </span>
                <br>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The interactions in this visualization occur then the diverging direction
                bar is toggled and the map of cases updates accordingly
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="title">Personal Thoughts: </span>
                <br/>
                &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I believe that this a good visualization due to the fact the bottom scroll
                bar on the image allows you to see the
                growth in cases from the time they were initially monitored all the way until the current date. Also
                through color coordination
                their is a clear visual concerning the places that were most infected by the virus
